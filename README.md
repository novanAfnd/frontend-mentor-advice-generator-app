## My process

### Built with

- Vite + React
- BEM Convention
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It's my first time learning React JS. It's in the AdivceCard.jsx file if you want to see the code. I don't know what part I should recap because I just learned everything.

### Continued development

Hopefully I'll learn React JS again or maybe Next JS.
